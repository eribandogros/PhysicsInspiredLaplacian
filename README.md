# PhysicsInspiredLaplacian
The expressiveness of Laplacian spectra is repackaged in the context of the Hamiltonian operator, describing the total energy of a particle system. We then use varying spectral sets as features for machine learning prediction tasks, specifically hERG binding and affinity prediction.
